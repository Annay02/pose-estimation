# Pose estimation

# Introduction 
This work focuses on an automated system for assessing fall risk in the elderly using the Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test. It utilizes a standard camera and 2D pose estimation to track key body points, providing an objective, cost-effective alternative for clinical mobility evaluation.


# Graphs 
* The file "CodeTug.m" loads data from two files, calculates the mean values for each file, plots the means, and shows the differences at various time points. It provides a visual comparison of the differences between automatic and manual timing for a "Time Up and Go" test.

The graph titled "Average for Manual and Automatic Time Up and Go"displays the mean values of the times recorded manually and automatically. This graph highlights the average performance time recorded by each method, allowing for a straightforward comparison of their results across different test runs.

The graph shows time differences between automatic and manual Time Up and Go (TUG) measurements for steps 1â€“6. Each point represents the average difference per step, with error bars showing standard deviation. Positive values mean the automatic method took longer; negative values mean it was faster.
